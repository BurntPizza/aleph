* read()
:: InputStream, ReaderContext -> Result<(Form, ReaderContext), ReaderContext>
Parameter mutability or ownership?
Figure out convention; mutable object method, 
function with mutable arg, some kind of monadic combinator?
Leaning towards combinator, but don't know how that will play out.
** InputStream
Error recovery?
** ReaderContext
Keeps track of:
- ReadErrors
- ReaderMacros
- 
** Form
Lexical program representation (post reader macro expansion): tree of tokens.
To support error recovery:
*** Span
